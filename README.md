# 🗄️ TinyDB - Java-Based File System DBMS

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a custom-built file-based **Database Management System (DBMS)** developed entirely using **Core Java**, without relying on any external frameworks or database engines.

It simulates a lightweight version of how relational databases operate under the hood by implementing:

- File-based database and table creation
- Support for `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands
- Transaction management (`START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)
- Schema validation and datatype checks
- Temporary and persistent data storage separation
- Basic user authentication with username and password validation

All operations are processed through a CLI interface, and the data is stored in structured `.txt` files, organized by database and table.

This project was developed with the goal of mimicking real-life DBMS behaviors at a fundamental level—handling storage, data integrity, user management, and safe transaction processing.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built this project as a personal initiative to **understand how databases work behind the scenes**—how data is stored, accessed, and secured.

While working with SQL and modern databases, I was always curious about what really happens when you run a query, how transactions are maintained, and how data is stored and retrieved efficiently. By creating my own simplified DBMS in Java, I got to **experience the internals of database management firsthand.**

I also wanted to challenge myself to build something functional using only Core Java, and this project turned out to be the perfect learning ground.

## ✨ Key Learnings

- Gained deep understanding of **how data is structured and managed** in databases
- Learned to implement **ACID transactions** using custom logic and temporary storage
- Understood the importance of **schema design, validation, and type safety**
- Realized the complexity of **user management** and securing credentials, even at a small scale
- Appreciated the power of abstraction and modular design while handling real-world-like data operations
